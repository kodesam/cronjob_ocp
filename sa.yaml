# Service Account Creation and Cluster Role Binding

```
oc create sa reader -n ocsa
```

- Add the `cluster-admin` role to the service account using the `oc adm policy` command. For example, to add the role to the `reader` service account in the `default` project, you can run this command:

```
oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user cluster-admin system:serviceaccount:open-caas-ops:ocsa
```
